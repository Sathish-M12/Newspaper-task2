            Defending champions England showcased a remarkable turnaround in their T20 World Cup campaign, securing a convincing eight-wicket victory over the previously undefeated West Indies in their Super Eight opener in St. Lucia. The English bowlers put up a disciplined performance to restrict the West Indies to 180-4 on a pitch where the hosts had recently scored 218 against Afghanistan. England's Phil Salt then starred with the bat, smashing 87 runs off just 47 balls to chase down the target in under 18 overs.
    
                    This victory holds particular significance for England, who had narrowly advanced to the Super Eight stage based on net run rate. The win over a strong West Indies side provides a significant confidence boost as England now tops Group 2 alongside South Africa, whom they face next at the same venue on Friday.<p>The T20 World Cup 2024 promises an electrifying clash among 20 cricketing giants, with matches scheduled across various venues in the United States of America and the West Indies. Organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC), the tournament features a total of 55 matches, commencing on June 1, 2024, and culminating with the final showdown on June 29, 2024. This highly anticipated event is set to captivate cricket fans around the globe with its blend of top-tier cricketing action and the vibrant cultures of the host nations.</p></div>

            The Supreme Court on June 21 asked the National Testing Agency (NTA) to respond to pleas for conducting a fresh National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) 2024 after allegations of question paper leaks and other irregularities have dented the sanctity of the national-level exams for undergraduate medical admissions which saw 24 lakh aspirants appear across the country.</p>

            <p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.</p>

            <p>Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels.  I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.</p>

When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath</p></div>

He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. </p>
					
					<p>His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. </p></div>
